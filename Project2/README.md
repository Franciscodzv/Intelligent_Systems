# Project 2 - Gasoline Price Prediction in Mexico

This proyect implements a gradient descent algorithm to perform a linear regression on a dataset of gasoline prices in Mexico. The dataset includes the price of gasoline, latitude and longitude, and year of a gas station. 

The program preprocesses the dataset by normalizing the input features and splitting it into training and test sets. It then trains a linear regression model on the training set and evaluates it on the test set. Finally, it plots the evolution of the cost function during training and computes the $R^2$ and mean squared error (MSE) of the trained model on the test set and training sets.

## How to run the program
Whenever you need to run the program you must make sure you have the following packages: numpy, random, csv and matplotlib.
