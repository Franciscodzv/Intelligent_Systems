# Project 1 - Linear Regression
This project uses Linear regression to predict how popular a song can be based on some of its features. The data I used is from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vicsuperman/prediction-of-music-genre 

The data contains several columns, but I only used the following columns: Energy, Danceability, and Instrumentalness. I also used the column "Popularity" as the target variable. I used these columns because I want to know how much the actual music and vibe of the song affects its popularity.

As of this project I was only able to get my coefficient of determination is 0.45. This is a good start, however, for making more precise predictions I would need to either use a different model or to handle the data and "clean" it before making the predictions.
